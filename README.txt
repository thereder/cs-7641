# cs-7641
I used jupyter notebooks for this assignment. All charts in the report can be reproduced using these files. <br>
Each .ipynb corresponds to one dataset. <br>
make sure you have pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn installed. <br>
To download the code and dataset, open your terminal and enter.  <br>
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/thereder/cs-7641.git
```
To run the code, you need to open it in jupyter notebook or jupyter lab then click on "Run All Cells".
You can type in below command in terminal to open jupyter lab. 
```bash
jupyter lab
```
